 <p class="first-paragraph">A <b>seashell</b> or <b>sea shell</b>, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal or organism that lives in the sea. Most seashells are made by mollusks, such as snails, clams, and oysters to protect their soft insides.Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by another organism.</p>
 <p class="first-paragraph">A seashell is usually the <mark>exoskeleton</mark> of an invertebrate (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of marine mollusks, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.</p>
 <p class="first-paragraph">Apart from mollusk shells, other shells that can be found on beaches are those of barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of sea urchins are called "tests", and the moulted shells of crabs and lobsters are exuviae. While most seashells are external, some cephalopods have internal shells.</p>
 <p class="first-paragraph">Seashells have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and prehistory. However, seashells are not the only kind of shells; in various habitats, there are shells from freshwater animals such as freshwater mussels and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.</p>
</div>

<div class="Second-Paragraph">
 <h2>Terminology</h2>
 <p>When the word "seashells" refers only to the shells of marine mollusks, then studying seashells is part of conchology. Conchologists or serious collectors who have a scientific bias are in general careful not to disturb living populations and habitats: even though they may collect a few live animals, most responsible collectors do not often over-collect or otherwise disturb ecosystems.</p>
 <p>The study of the entire molluscan animal (as well as the shell) is known as malacology; a person who studies mollusks is known as a malacologist.</p>
</div>

<h2>Their Occurance</h2>
<p>Seashells are commonly found in beach drift, which is <i>natural detritus</i> deposited along strandlines on beaches by the waves and the tides. Shells are very often washed up onto a beach empty and clean, the animal having already died.</p>
<p>Empty seashells are often picked up by beachcombers. However, the majority of seashells which are offered for sale commercially have been collected alive (often in bulk) and then killed and cleaned, specifically for the commercial trade. This type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local ecosystems, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of rare species.</p>

<h2>Shell Synthesis</h2>
<p>Seashells are created by the <mark>molluscs</mark> that use them for protection. Molluscs have an outside layer of tissues on their bodies – the mantle – which creates the shell material and which connects the shell to the mollusc. The specialized cells in the mantle form the shell using different minerals and proteins. The proteins are then used to create the framework that supports the growing shell. <i>Calcium carbonate is the main compound of shell structure, aiding in adhesion</i>.</p>

<h3>Molluscan seashells</h3>

<p>The word seashell is often used to mean only the shell of a marine mollusk. Marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called "seashells" are the shells of marine species of <i>bivalves</i> (or clams), <i>gastropods</i> (or snails), <i>scaphopods</i> (or tusk shells), <i>polyplacophorans</i> (or chitons), and <i>cephalopods</i> (such as nautilus and spirula). These shells are very often the most commonly encountered, both in the wild, and for sale as decorative objects.</p>
<p>Marine species of gastropods and bivalves are more numerous than land and freshwater species, and the shells are often larger and more robust. The shells of marine species also often have more sculpture and more color, although this is by no means always the case.</p>
<p>In the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the planet, there are far more species of colorful, large, shallow water shelled marine mollusks than there are in the temperate zones and the regions closer to the poles.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Bivalves</b></li>
    <i>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia">Bivalvia</a></i>
    <p>Bivalves are often the most common seashells that wash up on large sandy beaches or in sheltered lagoons. They can sometimes be extremely numerous. Very often the two valves become separated.</p>
   
    <li><b>Gastropods</b></li>
    <i>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropod_shell">Gastropod shell</a></i>
    <p>Certain species of gastropod seashells (the shells of sea snails) can sometimes be common, washed up on sandy beaches, and also on beaches that are surrounded by rocky marine habitat.</p>
   
    <li><b>Polyplacophorans</b></li>
    <i>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiton">Chiton</a></i>
    <p>Chiton plates or valves often wash up on beaches in rocky areas where chitons are common. Chiton shells, which are composed of eight separate plates and a girdle, usually come apart not long after death, so they are almost always found as disarticulated plates. Plates from larger species of chitons are sometimes known as "butterfly shells" because of their shape.</p>
   
    <li><b>Polyplacophorans</b></li>
    <i>Main article:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod">Cephalopod</a></i>
    <p>Only a few species of cephalopods have shells (either internal or external) that are sometimes found washed up on beaches. Some cephalopods such as Sepia, the cuttlefish, have a large internal shell, the cuttlefish bone, and this often washes up on beaches in parts of the world where cuttlefish are common.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Molluscan seashells used by other animals</h3>

<p>Empty molluscan seashells are a sturdy, and usually readily available, "free" resource which is often easily found on beaches, in the <i>intertidal zone</i>, and in the shallow subtidal zone. As such they are sometimes used second-hand by animals other than humans for various purposes, including for protection (as in hermit crabs) and for construction.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Mollusks</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrier shells in the family Xenophoridae are marine shelled gastropods, fairly large sea snails. Most species of xenophorids cement a series of objects to the rim of their shells as they grow. These objects are sometimes small pebbles or other hard detritus. Very often shells of bivalves or smaller gastropods are used, depending on what is available on the particular substrate where the snail itself lives. It is not clear whether these shell attachments serve as camouflage, or whether they are intended to help prevent the shell sinking into a soft substrate.</li>
        <li>Small octopuses sometimes use an empty shell as a sort of cave to hide in, or hold seashells around themselves as a form of protection like a temporary fortress.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Invertebrates</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Almost all genera of hermit crabs use or "wear" empty marine gastropod shells throughout their lifespan, in order to protect their soft abdomens, and in order to have a strong shell to withdraw into if attacked by a predator. Each individual hermit crab is forced to find another gastropod shell on a regular basis, whenever it grows too large for the one it is currently using. Some hermit crab species live on land and may be found quite some distance from the sea, including those in the tropical genus Coenobita.</li>
