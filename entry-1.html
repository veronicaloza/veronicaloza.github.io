<h1>Seashell</h1>
<i>Not to be confused with Seychelles.</i>
<p>A <b>seashell</b> or <b>sea shell</b>, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal or organism that lives in the sea. Most seashells are made by mollusks, such as snails, clams, and oysters to protect their soft insides.Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by another organism.</p>
<p>A seashell is usually the <mark>exoskeleton</mark> of an invertebrate (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of marine mollusks, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.</p>


<h2>Their Occurance</h2>
<p>Seashells are commonly found in beach drift, which is <i>natural detritus</i> deposited along strandlines on beaches by the waves and the tides. Shells are very often washed up onto a beach empty and clean, the animal having already died.</p>
<p>Empty seashells are often picked up by beachcombers. However, the majority of seashells which are offered for sale commercially have been collected alive (often in bulk) and then killed and cleaned, specifically for the commercial trade. This type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local ecosystems, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of rare species.</p>

<h2>Shell Synthesis</h2>
<p>Seashells are created by the <mark>molluscs</mark> that use them for protection. Molluscs have an outside layer of tissues on their bodies – the mantle – which creates the shell material and which connects the shell to the mollusc. The specialized cells in the mantle form the shell using different minerals and proteins. The proteins are then used to create the framework that supports the growing shell. <i>Calcium carbonate is the main compound of shell structure, aiding in adhesion</i>.</p>

<h3>Molluscan seashells</h3>

<p>The word seashell is often used to mean only the shell of a marine mollusk. Marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called "seashells" are the shells of marine species of <i>bivalves</i> (or clams), <i>gastropods</i> (or snails), <i>scaphopods</i>(or tusk shells), <i>polyplacophorans</i> (or chitons), and <i>cephalopods</i> (such as nautilus and spirula). These shells are very often the most commonly encountered, both in the wild, and for sale as decorative objects.</p>
<p>Marine species of gastropods and bivalves are more numerous than land and freshwater species, and the shells are often larger and more robust. The shells of marine species also often have more sculpture and more color, although this is by no means always the case.</p>
<p>In the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the planet, there are far more species of colorful, large, shallow water shelled marine mollusks than there are in the temperate zones and the regions closer to the poles.</p>

    <li>Gastropods</li>
    <li>Polyplacophorans</li>
    <li>Cephalopods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Molluscan seashells used by other animals</h3>

<p>Empty molluscan seashells are a sturdy, and usually readily available, "free" resource which is often easily found on beaches, in the <i>intertidal zone</i>, and in the shallow subtidal zone. As such they are sometimes used second-hand by animals other than humans for various purposes, including for protection (as in hermit crabs) and for construction.</p>
