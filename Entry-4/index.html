     <h1>Mussels</h1>
     <hr>
     <p>A seashell isn’t an animal. It’s a portable home for a wide variety of animals. The animals that naturally live in these homes are mollusks.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Before tackling hermit crabs, let’s get one important fact out of the way: mollusks craft only one shell throughout their lifetime.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>The only exceptions here are hermit crabs. They aren’t mollusks – they’re crustaceans. Despite this, they use seashells too.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>We mentioned above that cephalopods, like octopi and squids, are mollusks that don’t build a shell. There is one type of octopus, however, that didn’t evolve this way: the Argonaut.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Aren’t seashells pretty? They often display a wide array of colors and unique patterns. However, it turns out those beautiful designs aren’t for display only.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Found a beautiful seashell while walking down the beach? Great, but how do you tell what kind of animal it was for?</p>
     <hr>
     <p>While there are thousands of seashells, you can boil them down to two major types and two general shapes. Let’s discuss the shapes first.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>The first type is the flat shell. These are common for oysters and clams. More often than not, these are bivalve shells.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Did you know the vast majority of shells are dextral? This means their opening is to the right. Only a select few shells are sinistral, meaning they open to the left.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Cowry shells functioned as currency in places like China, India, and even in the Arabian peninsula. </p>
     <hr>
     <p>Seashells make for great souvenirs. You’ll find them used as earrings, necklace pendants, or even wallet adornments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Remember a while back we mentioned how seashells are great for amplifying ambient sounds? This same property makes them ideal wind instruments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Looking for the ultimate shell destination? There’s a beach that stretches over 74 feet and goes as far down as 32 feet, located in Western Australia.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Remember we said mollusks make their shells out of calcium carbonate? This very property also makes shells an amazing ingredient for effective fertilizers.</p>
     <hr>
     <p> As a matter of fact, newer discoveries hint that Homo Sapiens were not the first ones to convey a sense of art on a wall or shell.</p>
