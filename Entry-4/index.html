    <p class="first-line"><span class=first-scentence>1.</span> <span class="all-selected-a">A</span> seashell <span
            class="isnt">isn't</span> an animal. It’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> <span
            class="portable">portable</span> home <span class="ivyora">for</span> <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>
        wide variety of animals. <span class="the">The</span><span class="tiny-font">animals</span> that <span
            class="ivyora">naturally</span> live in these homes are mollusks.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="second-line"><span class=first-scentence>2.</span>Before tackling <span class="isnt">hermit</span> crabs,
        let’s get one important fact out of<span class="the">the</span> way:<span class="isnt">mollusks</span><span
            class="tiny-font">craft</span> only one shell throughout their lifetime.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="third-line"><span class=first-scentence>3.</span><span class="the">The</span> only <span
            class="tiny-font">exceptions</span> here are hermit crabs. They aren’t mollusks – they’re <span
            class="isnt">crustaceans</span>. Despite this, they use seashells <span class="tiny-font">too</span>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="fourth-line"><span class=first-scentence>4.</span>We mentioned above that <span
            class="isnt">cephalopods</span>, like octopi and squids, are mollusks that don’t build <span
            class="all-selected-a">a</span> shell. There is one type of octopus, however, that didn’t evolve this way:
        the Argonaut.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="fifth-line"><span class=first-scentence>5.</span>Aren’t seashells <span class="isnt">pretty?</span> They
        often display <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wide array of colors and unique patterns. However, it turns
        out those <span class="tiny-font">beautiful</span> designs aren’t for display only.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="sixth-line"><span class=first-scentence>6.</span>Found a beautiful seashell while walking down <span
            class="the">the</span><span class="tiny-font">beach?</span> Great, but how do you tell what kind of <span
            class="isnt">animal</span> it was for?</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="seventh-line"><span class=first-scentence>7.</span> While there are <span class="number">thousands</span>
        of seashells, you can <span class="isnt">boil</span> them down to two major types and two general shapes. Let’s
        <span class="tiny-font">discuss</span> <span class="the">the</span> shapes first.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="eighth-line"><span class=first-scentence>8.</span> <span class="the">The</span> first type is <span
            class="the">the</span> flat shell. These are common for <span class="isnt">oysters</span> and clams. More
        <span class="tiny-font">often</span> than not, these are bivalve shells.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="ninth-line"><span class=first-scentence>9.</span> Did you know the vast <span
            class="tiny-font">majority</span> of shells are <span class="isnt">dextral?</span> This means their opening
        is to the right. Only <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> select few shells are sinistral, <span
            class="tiny-font">meaning</span> they open to <span class="the">the</span> left.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="tenth-line"><span class=first-scentence>10.</span> Cowry <span class="tiny-font">shells</span> functioned
        as<span class="isnt">currency</span> in places like China, India, and even in <span class="the">the</span>
        Arabian <span class="tiny-font">penunsula</span>. </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="eleventh-line"><span class=first-scentence>11.</span>Seashells make for <span
            class="tiny-font">great</span> <span class="isnt">souvenirs</span>. You’ll find them used as earrings,
        necklace pendants, or even <span class="tiny-font">wallet</span> adornments.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="twelfth-line"><span class=first-scentence>12.</span>Remember while back we mentioned how seashells are
        great for <span class="tiny-font">amplifying</span> ambient sounds? This same <span class="isnt">property</span>
        makes them ideal wind <span class="tiny-font">instruments</span>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="line-thirteen"><span class=first-scentence>13.</span>Looking for the ultimate shell <span
            class="isnt">destination?</span> There’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> beach that stretches over
        <span class="number">74</span> feet and goes as far down as <span class="number">32</span> feet, located in
        Western Australia.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="line-fourteen"><span class=first-scentence>14.</span>Remember we said mollusks make their shells out of
        <span class="tiny-font">calcium carbonate</span>? This very property also makes shells an amazing <span
            class="isnt">ingredient</span> for effective <span class="tiny-font">fertilizers</span>.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="line-fifteenth"><span class=first-scentence>15.</span>As <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> matter of
        fact, <span class="tiny-font">newer</span> discoveries hint that <span class="isnt">Homo</span> <span
            class="tiny-font">Sapiens</span> were not the first ones to convey <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>
        sense of art on <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wall or shell.</p>
