        <div class="hide-seashell"> Tired of reading  about Seashells?

         <p>A <span>seashell</span> or <span>sea shell</span><span class="punction">,</span> also known simply as a <span>shell</span><span class="punction">,</span> is a hard<span class="punction">,</span> protective outer layer usually created by an animal or   organism that lives in the sea<span class="punction">.</span><p>
    
         <p> Most <span>seashells</span> are made by mollusks<span class="punction">,</span> such as snails<span class="punction">,</span> clams<span class="punction">,</span> and oysters to protect their soft insides<span class="punction">.</span></p>
         
         <p>Empty <span>seashells</span> are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers<span class="punction">.</span> The <span>shell</span> are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by another organism<span class="punction">.</span></p>
         <p>A <span>seashell</span> is usually the exoskeleton  of an invertebrate (an animal without a backbone)<span class="punction">,</span> and is typically composed of calcium carbonate or chitin<span class="punction">.</span> Most <span>shells</span> that are found on beaches are the <span>shells</span> of marine mollusks<span class="punction">,</span> partly because these <span>shells</span> are usually made of calcium carbonate<span class="punction">,</span> and endure better than <span>shells</span> made of chitin<span class="punction">.</span></p>
         <p>Apart from mollusk <span>shells</span><span class="punction">,</span> other <span>shells</span> that can be found on beaches are those of barnacles<span class="punction">,</span> horseshoe crabs and brachiopods<span class="punction">.</span> Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create <span>shells</span> which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces<span class="punction">.</span> The <span>shells</span> of sea urchins are called "tests"<span class="punction">,</span> and the moulted <span>shells</span> of crabs and lobsters are exuviae<span class="punction">.</span> While most <span>seashells</span> are external, some cephalopods have internal shells<span class="punction">.</span></p>
         <p><span>Seashells</span> have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and prehistory<span class="punction">.</span> However<span class="punction">,</span><span>seashells</span> are not the only kind of <span>shells</span><span class="punction">;</span> in various habitats<span class="punction">,</span> there are <span>shells</span> from freshwater animals such as freshwater mussels and freshwater snails<span class="punction">,</span> and <span>shells</span> of land snails<span class="punction">.</span></p>
