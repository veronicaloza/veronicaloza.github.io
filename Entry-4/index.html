     <p class="first-line"><span class=first-scentence>1.</span> <span class="all-selected-a">A</span> seashell <span class="isnt">isn't</span> an animal. It’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> <span class="portable">portable</span> home for <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wide variety of animals. <span class="the">The</span> animals that naturally live in these homes are mollusks.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="second-line"><span class=first-scentence>2.</span>Before tackling hermit crabs, let’s get one important fact out of<span class="the">the</span>  way:<span class="isnt">mollusks</span><span class="tiny-font">craft</span> only one shell throughout their lifetime.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="third-line"><span class=first-scentence>3.</span><span class="the">The</span> only exceptions here are hermit crabs. They aren’t mollusks – they’re crustaceans. Despite this, they use seashells too.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="fourth-line"><span class=first-scentence>4.</span>We mentioned above that cephalopods, like octopi and squids, are mollusks that don’t build <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> shell. There is one type of octopus, however, that didn’t evolve this way: the Argonaut.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="fifth-line"><span class=first-scentence>5.</span>Aren’t seashells pretty? They often display <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wide array of colors and unique patterns. However, it turns out those beautiful designs aren’t for display only.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="sixth-line"><span class=first-scentence>6.</span>Found a beautiful seashell while walking down <span class="the">the</span> beach? Great, but how do you tell what kind of animal it was for?</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="seventh-line"><span class=first-scentence>7.</span> While there are thousands of seashells, you can boil them down to two major types and two general shapes. Let’s discuss <span class="the">the</span> shapes first.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="eighth-line"><span class=first-scentence>8.</span> <span class="the">The</span> first type is <span class="the">the</span> flat shell. These are common for oysters and clams. More often than not, these are bivalve shells.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="ninth-line"><span class=first-scentence>9.</span> Did you know the vast majority of shells are dextral? This means their opening is to the right. Only <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> select few shells are sinistral, meaning they open to <span class="the">the</span> left.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="tenth-line"><span class=first-scentence>10.</span> Cowry shells functioned as currency in places like China, India, and even in <span class="the">the</span> Arabian peninsula. </p>
     <hr>
     <p class="eleventh-line"><span class=first-scentence>11.</span>Seashells make for great souvenirs. You’ll find them used as earrings, necklace pendants, or even wallet adornments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="twelfth-line"><span class=first-scentence>12.</span>Remember while back we mentioned how seashells are great for amplifying ambient sounds? This same property makes them ideal wind instruments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="line-thirteen"><span class=first-scentence>13.</span>Looking for the ultimate shell destination? There’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  beach that stretches over 74 feet and goes as far down as 32 feet, located in Western Australia.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="line-fourteen"><span class=first-scentence>14.</span>Remember we said mollusks make their shells out of calcium carbonate? This very property also makes shells an amazing ingredient for effective fertilizers.</p>
     <hr>
     <p class="line-fifteenth"><span class=first-scentence>15.</span>As <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  matter of fact, newer discoveries hint that Homo Sapiens were not the first ones to convey <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  sense of art on <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  wall or shell.</p>
