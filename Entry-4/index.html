     <p class="first-line"><span class=first-scentence>1.</span> <span class="all-selected-a">A</span> seashell isn’t an animal. It’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> portable home for <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wide variety of animals. The animals that naturally live in these homes are mollusks.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>2.Before tackling hermit crabs, let’s get one important fact out of the way: mollusks craft only one shell throughout their lifetime.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>3.The only exceptions here are hermit crabs. They aren’t mollusks – they’re crustaceans. Despite this, they use seashells too.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>4.We mentioned above that cephalopods, like octopi and squids, are mollusks that don’t build <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> shell. There is one type of octopus, however, that didn’t evolve this way: the Argonaut.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>5.Aren’t seashells pretty? They often display <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> wide array of colors and unique patterns. However, it turns out those beautiful designs aren’t for display only.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>6.Found a beautiful seashell while walking down the beach? Great, but how do you tell what kind of animal it was for?</p>
     <hr>
     <p>7.While there are thousands of seashells, you can boil them down to two major types and two general shapes. Let’s discuss the shapes first.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>8.The first type is the flat shell. These are common for oysters and clams. More often than not, these are bivalve shells.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>9.Did you know the vast majority of shells are dextral? This means their opening is to the right. Only <span class="all-selected-a">a</span> select few shells are sinistral, meaning they open to the left.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>10.Cowry shells functioned as currency in places like China, India, and even in the Arabian peninsula. </p>
     <hr>
     <p>11.Seashells make for great souvenirs. You’ll find them used as earrings, necklace pendants, or even wallet adornments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>12.Remember while back we mentioned how seashells are great for amplifying ambient sounds? This same property makes them ideal wind instruments.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>13.Looking for the ultimate shell destination? There’s <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  beach that stretches over 74 feet and goes as far down as 32 feet, located in Western Australia.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>14.Remember we said mollusks make their shells out of calcium carbonate? This very property also makes shells an amazing ingredient for effective fertilizers.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>15.As <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  matter of fact, newer discoveries hint that Homo Sapiens were not the first ones to convey <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  sense of art on <span class="all-selected-a">a</span>  wall or shell.</p>
